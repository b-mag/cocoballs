A Vectrex adaptation of Steve Bjork's 3 ball demo made for the Tandy Color Computer

Not a game, just a learning demo.  I watched the 12 part series on youtube and the final episode had a bouncing ball demo.  I ported his code over to the Vectrex.

For people interested in 6809 assembly it has quite a few interesting things.  For myself the most interesting was the use of structured data 'objects' in memory and reuseable sections of code that would loop through those objects performing some task.
